default layout problem
either remove direct html rendering or include feature for seting a layout
json response
different error behaviours on production and development
Initialise envs inside application and access envs through application and throw error if env object is not initialised 
only sanitize 'output' and sanitize only when necessary
use static functions whenever possible
choose better sanitizing methods if there is
add csrf protection
automatic class generation
migrations
